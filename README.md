# Roman Numerals Kata Attempt 1

This is part of a training exercise to complete the Roman Numerals Kata in under 10 minutes. This attempt took me much longer than that because I was following a video tutorial in another language and I was translating to JS ES6. 

I have tested for some random numbers including 2999 (the last required)to check that the algorithm works. 

The next attempts will be done without the aid of the video tutorial.
